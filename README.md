## What is this?

I'm trying to learn how _git_ and _Github_ works. I'm already familiar with Github (like Github using it's own flavoured markdown), so it should be easier for me lol

## Why do it in front of everyine when you could just-

Well:

1. No one would see this anyway (lol)
2. It's just better for me as I learn easier when I directly try it :)

Look, I even type while following all of the grammar rules, just for y'all (i normally type like this xd). so, _uhm_
Wish me luck, people!
